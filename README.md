## 2025-05-05

I'll write the TIL here and later move it to the correct file.

First I learned about static sites (using quarto) and found a convenient way to deploy them on GitHub Pages.

Next came the requirement to have at least some dynamic content so I experimented with pyodide. I am impressed for example with jupyterlite and marimbo.

Trying to stay away from full fledged frontend frameworks like react/vue, I am trying to do some frontend work with just HTML and htmx and (tabulator javascript lib).

Anyway, it soon becomes apparant that certain use cases require persistence. Hence I am now trying to work with sqlite3. Second, I did a prototype with Python.

The current idea is to pause doing a third (FastAPI) prototype. Instead I will look to improve SQLFlask to try and do some production work with it (either grading or excel).

The stack I am considering: SQLite, Polars, Flask, Jinja2, Svelte/Tanstack tables.
Utility services I am planning to use: sentry, auth0
